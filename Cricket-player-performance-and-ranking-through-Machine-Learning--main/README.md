Cricket Series Ranking and Performance Analysis
 
Machine learning is very helpful in getting the possible outcomes of the event happening, with it past data or past experience. Our idea of machine learning project is that  we are going to predict the best team using different criteria like Strike rate, Runs/Economy, Average etc. The method we use Rising Star in which there different factors which are calculated using these criteria and based on which a final score is given to a player by this we will get score of each player and can predict the best team. For this we are seeing the previous data of that player or team. Through rising star concept we have formulated the weighted average and rising star value of the player on his previous performance. We have used K-means clusting and applied on any particular series (eg. Sri Lanka in India ODI Series,England in Bangladesh ODI Series, etc). Through clusting we have analyzed the performance of player, therefore any team selector can review any particular series and from this they can made decision on any player's performance.
