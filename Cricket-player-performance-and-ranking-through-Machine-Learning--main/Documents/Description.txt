                                    Machine learning – Project Description

                                “Cricket match analysis and score prediction”
                                    
 
Machine learning is very helpful in getting the possible outcomes of the event happening, with it past data or past experience. Our idea of machine learning project is that  we are going to predict the best team using different criteria like Strike rate, Runs/Economy, Average etc. The method we use Rising Star in which there different factors which are calculated using these criteria and based on which a final score is given to a player by this we will get score of each player and can predict the best team.  For this we are seeing the previous data of that player or team.

Thank you
